This Project implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in C++/Qt.
The algorithm implemented is slightly different from the traditional version. 
This version is  presented in the paper: "Handling Constraints in Particle Swarm Optimization using a Small Population Size"

The example in this code is a Speed Reducer design optimization problem, and can be found in the link bellow:
